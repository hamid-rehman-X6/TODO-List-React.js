# Todo Application in React
This React application is a simple Todo list manager that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface with separate sections for active tasks and completed tasks.

# Key Features:
**Add Todo:** Users can input a task title and description, and upon clicking the "Add" button, the task is added to the list. 
**Delete Todo:** Each task in the active Todo list has a delete icon (trash can), allowing users to remove unwanted tasks.
**Complete Todo:** Users can mark a task as completed by clicking the checkmark icon. The completed task is then moved to a separate "Completed" section.
**Delete Completed:** In the "Completed" section, users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
**Storage:** The application uses localStorage to persist the Todo list and completed tasks even after the user refreshes or closes the browser.

## Usage:
### Clone the repository.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Run npm start to start the development server.

## Note:
This Todo application is a great starting point for those learning React or looking for a simple project to manage and organize tasks. The code structure is clean and well-commented, making it easy for developers to understand and customize the application according to their needs.
